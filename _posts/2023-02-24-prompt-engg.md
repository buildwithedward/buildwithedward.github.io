Have you ever heard about prompt engineering recently?

You see some YouTube videos of a few influencers/ solopreneurs who make quick money with Large Language Models (ChatGPT/GPT3 -> text-to-text generator /Mid-Journey -> text-to-image generator) or make apps with Large Language Models. Ok, now you tried to create the same with a few ideas in mind, but the results generated aren't up to the mark!

Then it's time for you to learn Prompt Engineering!

Prompt engineering is crafting just the right prompts to get an AI system to do what you want. It's like whispering sweet nothings in a robot's ear to make it dance to your tune. And why is it so important? Well, without sound prompt engineering, you could end up with an AI that's about as useful as a monkey with a typewriter. But with the right prompts, you can make an AI that's smarter than a rocket scientist, and more charming than a Hollywood heartthrob. (On a secret note: The above paragraph is created with ChatGPT ðŸ˜…ðŸ¤«)

You don't have to be a data scientist or know code to create AI-related apps. Companies now prefer candidates who know prompt engineering above data scientists or AI knowledge.
