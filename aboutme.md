Hello! I am Edward Praveen. I am a Data Scientist at Ruah Tech Solutions, Chennai.

### My story

In my educational journey, I attended Engineering School in Thuckalay and subsequently pursued a Masters in Business Administration from the esteemed VIT. It was during my time as a master's student that I realized the significance of data and its various applications. 

I then joined Lyca Mobile Private Limited, where I gained hands-on experience working with SQL. My responsibilities included Data Manipulation, Reports Generation, and utilizing Big Data for Fraud Detection purposes.

Seeking to enhance my technical skills, I developed a keen interest in the field of Machine Learning. Currently, I am actively engaged in NLP and Computer Vision projects, while also immersing myself in the study of Data Engineering. My goal is to create comprehensive data products that encompass the entire data pipeline.
