Hello! I am Edward Praveen. I am a Data Scientist.

### My story

After completing my Engineering degree in Thuckalay, I pursued a Masters in Business Administration from the renowned VIT. During my time as a postgraduate student, I came to realize the immense significance of data and its practical applications. This realization led me to join Lyca Mobile Private Limited, where I worked extensively with SQL, focusing on tasks such as Data Manipulation, Reports Generation, and Fraud Detection utilizing Big Data.

Driven by a desire to enhance my technical skills, I developed a keen interest in the field of Machine Learning. This interest opened up an opportunity for me to work as a data scientist in my current organization. 

In my role, I thoroughly comprehend the existing products within the company and strive to provide AI solutions as value-added services or innovative features. It's like combining AI expertise with elements of product management.
