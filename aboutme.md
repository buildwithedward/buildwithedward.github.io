Hello! I am Edward Praveen. I am a Data Scientist at Ruah Tech Solutions, Chennai. In the past, I had developed Fraud Management Solutions for a telecom with SQL and Python as tools.

### My story
I went to Engineering School in Thuckalay and then followed up with a Masters in Business Adminstration at the prestigious VIT. 
While pursuing my masters, I discovered the importance of data and its applications. I went on to work with Lycatel Mobile Private Limited. 
There, I worked with SQL which involves Data Manipulation, Reports Generation and Fraud Detection using Big Data. 

I wanted to upgrade my tech skills, and I cultivated an interest in the Machine Learning field. 
Currently I am working on NLP, Computer Vision Projects and learning Data Engineering to create end-to-end data products.
